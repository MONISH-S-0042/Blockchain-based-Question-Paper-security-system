Blockchain Secure Exam System
A proof-of-concept project that leverages blockchain technology to create a highly secure, transparent, and auditable system for distributing sensitive examination papers. This system is designed to prevent leaks, tampering, and unauthorized access by replacing traditional manual, trust-based methods with a decentralized, cryptographically secure workflow.
